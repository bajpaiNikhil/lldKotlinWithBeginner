# Low-Level Design in Kotlin (Beginner-Friendly)

Welcome to **lldKotlinWithBeginner** 🎉  

This repository is dedicated to **learning Low-Level Design (LLD)** using **Kotlin** with practical, step-by-step examples.  
It’s beginner-friendly and designed for developers who want to strengthen their **system design, object-oriented programming, and UML modeling** skills while coding in Kotlin.  

---

## 🚀 What’s Inside

Each project in this repo is a real-world **LLD case study**, implemented in Kotlin with a focus on:  

- **Object-Oriented Principles** – encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction  
- **Clean Architecture** – separating concerns for maintainability  
- **UML Diagrams + Code** – helping you visualize the design before writing code  
- **Practical Scenarios** – systems you encounter in real life  

### ✅ Completed LLD Implementations
- 🅿️ **Parking Lot System**  
- 🎬 **Movie Ticket Booking System (like BookMyShow)**  
- 🥤💳 **Vending Machine / ATM System**  
- 📚 **Library Management System**  

*(More coming soon!)*
